I work for a great environmental consulting firm and love my job. I also have an undying love of motorcycles, specifically sports bikes. I would like to tell you a little about myself before I get into the details of my business.  After all, a good idea is just that without someone to grow it into a profitable business. <br/><br/>I am what some would characterize, as an &ldquo;A-Type&rdquo; person.  When I set my mind on something, it always gets done.  Whether it is delivering projects on time and budget at work or promising to pick up a friend on the side of a road on my personal time, my word is good as titanium!  Therefore, I do not give my word lightly, unless I am sure I can deliver. From my core, I know this business will be profitable, even in this recession. I feel like this is perfect timing, while we are at the bottom of the recession and slowly climbing out.  I personally know this from the amount of jobs that are being designed and constructed in my firm. If you need to know more about the person behind the business, just ask.  I will try to respond right away, but sometimes this is not possible during my working day.  I will definitely answer your questions by the end of the workday.<br/><br/>I will be opening my motorcycle repair shop in the SOMA district in San Francisco, sometime in March 2011.  This will be my model shop, since I plan to expand to the rest of the Bay Area. I have about a fourth of the equipment for the shop, i.e., tire machine, hydraulic lift, and misc tools. I have very low overhead, since I will not be buying motorcycle apparel inventory.  Sometime in the future, I will be selling motorcycle apparel from a Japanese leather company that would like to start selling in the Bay Area, again.  I have a direct contact with one of the owners and I am brokering a deal that the shop will not incur upfront cost for the first six months.<br/><br/>I will be buying used motorcycles to recondition and sell. I already have two in my garage to sell. I plan to be an authorized repair facility with major insurance carriers, i.e., AAA, State Farm, Progressive, Geico Insurance, etc.  Motorcycle insurance jobs are usually several thousand dollars to repair on average and the shop will actively seek this type of repair jobs.<br/><br/>The business will be modeled similarly to a salon-type structure, whereas the mechanic will rent out a service station and will be able to use the shop equipment for a fee. The fee for renting out the service bay will be $1500.00 a month. All service technicians working for the shop will be able to handle any job, from a simple oil change to complete engine tear-down and rebuild. They will be paid a commission split of 60/40 (60% to the shop, 40% to mechanic). The shop labor rate will be between $88-$110 per hour, depending on the mechanic&rsquo;s level of experience. <br/><br/>With over 45 years of combined motorcycle service experience. I already have three journeyman mechanics onboard for my shop and they will be able to diagnosis and repair customer&rsquo;s vehicles quickly and correctly, the first time. By hiring journeyman mechanics, this will limit the number of incorrect diagnosis that plague shops that hire cheap, inexperienced mechanics with no former shop experience or that are fresh out of tech schools. After all, repeat business is how businesses survive the long haul.  I want to build an excellent reputation for the motorcycling community. <br/><br/>There are a lot of other great details, but I can only give a short description for now. Please contact me with any questions you may have.  Thank you ahead of time for your time and consideration.<br/> Borrower added on 11/23/10 > One more day left.

The Home down payment description was the best description available; although this is not a request towards the purchase of a home, it is a request towards renting a new home.  As many of you are likely aware, the upfront costs of moving into a new apartment can add up quickly to cover landlord requirements and the fees of the broker.  The Sanctuary building in which we would like to move into requires the upfront payments of first month's rent, last month's rent, a security deposit, and broker's fee.  With the rent equaling $2,600 per month, my request is for a $7,000 loan.  I am able to take care of 1st month's rent and a little extra, but require assistance on the other three payments.

I've worked at my job for just under two years now and will be looking at a second promotion very soon.  In honesty, the reason for the debt was poor spending in college and while living on my own.  Much of the overspending was just on food and gas.  I have turned everything around and the credit cards are all cut up and in a plastic baggy as a constant reminder that I am working my way out of that debt.  I have been very solid with my budget over the last six months and have only made a single small purchase on any credit card in that time.  I have a month-to-month plan for getting the debt paid off and I have followed it.  I am serious about getting this debt behind me so I can work toward buying a house.  Also, as any credit report of mine will show, I have never been delinquent on any payment and every account I have every had is in good standing.

I originally got a credit card because I couldn't afford my books, then I began to put a lot of my living expenses on it. Right now the card balance is over 5000. I have made every payment regularly except for one. During a particularly stressful part of my semester where I was swamped with classwork and planning a campus event I filled out my payment and put it in the envelope and sat it on my desk. I neglected to actually drop it in the mail. This resulted in my interest rate doubling to a whopping 28.9% a month. The interest is drowning me. I work two jobs and working as much as I do is starting to impact my schoolwork. Two weeks of paychecks from my retail job make me just enough money to pay the interest on the credit card, but all the other bills keep coming. I don't want to ask my parents for help or burden them in any way.  In a bad economy, when prospects are already pretty dismal for a recent grad a huge pile of debt doesn't help. I'm looking to take care of some of it so I can be independent and successful when I graduate.

Finally, with the remainder I am going to put towards 6 months of my car insurance policy, which is currently $154/month. I will have no problem paying this loan because without the car insurance and credit card, I will actually be paying LESS monthly than I already am!

We have hundreds of people on our mailing list who have expressed an interest in taking our tours. Right now we just have a few fees to pay, some maintenance costs for the busses, and to hire a driver that we already have interviewed. <br/><br/>About me: I have worked as a Senior Business Consultant in the franchise restaurant industry for the past 2 1/2 years now. I help franchisees build their sales and improve operations. I also manage a team of 5 people who do the same.<br/><br/>In my profession I have advised business owners big and small and I know what it takes to succeed and build a business such as this.<br/><br/>Let me know if you have any questions, I would be happy to answer them.<br/> Borrower added on 09/21/10 > 9/21- We are really grateful for all the support so far! We have just 9 more days and $7,000 left to go. It would mean the world to me if you could refer a friend to this page here or if you could lend any additional amount to help get this business off the ground. My current job will fully cover the payments and we have hundreds of customers who want to take our tours. Just $100 more dollars per existing lender could bring us to our goal almost overnight and you would be that much closer to making great returns on your investment!<br/>",small_business,Lending Club Loan,900xx,CA,6.7,0.0,Aug-03,1.0,,,7.0,0.0,4496,27.1,7.0,f,0.0,0.0,13194.55,12809.83,10000.0,3194.55,0.0,0.0,0.0,Nov-15,1.75,,Oct-15,0.0,,1,INDIVIDUAL,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
